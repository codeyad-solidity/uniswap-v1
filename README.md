# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Install Hardhat & nomicfoundation

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

# Install Openzeppelin & dotenv

```shell
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts dotenv
```
